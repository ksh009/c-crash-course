/*
    Ok, so, how are structures useful?
        Imagine you have to write a program to store different information about Cars, such as brand, model, and year. What's great about structures is that you can create a single "Car template" and use it for every cars you make. See below for a real life example.

    Real Life Example
        Use a structure to store different information about Cars:
*/

struct Car
{
    char brand[50];
    char model[50];
    int year;
};

int main()
{
    struct Car car1 = {"BMW", "X5", 1999};
    struct Car car2 = {"Ford", "Mustang", 1969};
    struct Car car3 = {"Toyota", "Corolla", 2011};

    printf("%s %s %d\n", car1.brand, car1.model, car1.year);
    printf("%s %s %d\n", car2.brand, car2.model, car2.year);
    printf("%s %s %d\n", car3.brand, car3.model, car3.year);

    return 0;
}
